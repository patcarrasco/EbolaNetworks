# Ebola Networks

This project uses a smallworld network to simulate the spread of ebolavirus through a small community. 

#### The default parameters for this model are as follows:
- Population = 1000
- Timesteps = 100
- CFR = 0.65
- Initial number of infected = 10
- Health workers in population = 10

#### Assumptions for model:
- Population is ignorant of ebolavirus
- Deceased individalas are buried the same day of death
- Deceased are more infectious than infected individuals
- Healers / Doctors will always seek to help infected

#### Tested parameters:
- Transmission from dead --> susceptible
- Transmission from infected --> susceptible
- Case Fatality Rate effect on transmission
- Amount of health workers effect on transmission
